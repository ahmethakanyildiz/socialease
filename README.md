# Mergen - Socialease
This is a project developed for the Software Engineering Lab in the spring semester of 2021. Developed by a team of 4 people.

##### Team Members
Ahmet Hakan YILDIZ (Frontend Developer - Backend Developer)<br/>
Onur ZEREN (Backend Developer)<br/>
Ahmet Fatih SOLAK (Backend Developer)<br/>
Bayram YILDIZ (Backend Developer)<br/>

I was responsible for project management. I worked as both frontend developer and backend developer. I also took care of the security side.

##### Used Technologies
React<br/>
Spring Boot<br/>
MySQL<br/>
##### About Commits
The first commit to this repository is the school submitted version. In the next commits, I plan to refactor the project, improve it in terms of security, and add new functionality (INDIVIDUALLY).

##### Warning
Lombok is a code generation library that can be integrated into the IDE while developing a Java project. Lombok integration is required in the developer version of this project! Otherwise, it will give an error.

### The changes that came with the second commit and the decision I made
There were some issues with the deleteClub and updateClub functions. Deleting a club/subclub was causing some data not to be deleted and bloating the database. These two functions have been updated.</br>
Added deleteUser function.</br>
The evaluateReport function was able to ban the reported user. I changed it to delete instead of ban. So when a user is reported and banned, his account is deleted.</br>
Some visual improvements have been made.</br></br>
Initially, I was planning to make this project better by updating it from time to time. But I realized that this would take a lot of time. Instead of refactoring this project, I decided to reengineer it. I will reengineer this project using MEAN stack technology. If we look at the final state of the project in general:</br>
All functions work smoothly.</br>
Satisfactory in terms of user interface.</br>
It contains some bugs.</br>
The project structure is somewhat complex. The reason of this complexity is that it is a school project and it is tried to be done in a very short time.</br>
During the development process, we could not take full advantage of the features and opportunities of the technologies we use. This was because we did not have much experience in the technologies we used.</br>
The complexity of the project and failure to use technologies properly led me to reengineer it.<br/>
### Announcement about the Socialease application to be developed with MEAN
I started to reengineer this application with MEAN Stack technology, but for some reason I could not spare time. Since it has been a long time and there are other projects that I want to develop, I decided to give up this project and wanted to write it here.
### Second announcement about this project
I had planned to reengineer this project, but then I gave up on doing it. But right now I decided to work on this project not only to stay sharp but also because I needed this type of project for some reason. I will not use MEAN stack technology. I am planning to use Spring Boot Framework and React Library. I will be very careful about design decisions and security issues. I will use this project as a basis, but I guess it will be like starting from scratch :) I will insert here project link when I start.
